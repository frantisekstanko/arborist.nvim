# arborist.nvim

WASM-first tree-sitter parser manager for Neovim 0.12+. Parsers install
automatically when you open files. No manual steps, no maintenance.

## Install

```lua
vim.pack.add({
  "https://github.com/arborist-ts/arborist.nvim",
})
```

Works out of the box with no setup call. To customize:

```lua
vim.pack.add({
  "https://github.com/arborist-ts/arborist.nvim",
})

vim.g.arborist_loaded = true -- skip auto-setup, we're configuring manually
require("arborist").setup({
  update_cadence = "weekly",
  overrides = {
    my_language = { url = "https://github.com/me/tree-sitter-my-language" },
  },
})
```

All options and their defaults:

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `prefer_wasm` | `true` | Try WASM before native compilation |
| `update_cadence` | `"daily"` | `"daily"`, `"weekly"`, or `"manual"` |
| `compiler` | `"cc"` | C compiler for native .so builds |
| `install_popular` | `true` | Install popular language parsers at startup |
| `ensure_installed` | `{}` | Additional parsers to install eagerly at startup |
| `ignore` | `{}` | Extra filetypes to skip (merged with registry defaults) |
| `overrides` | `{}` | Extra parsers not in the registry |

## Parsers and Queries

Arborist takes a two-pronged approach so everything works out of the box:

**Queries for 330 languages** are bundled with arborist.nvim, providing
syntax highlighting, folds, indents, and injections for every language
Neovim supports — no parser needed yet.

**Parsers for common languages** are installed eagerly at startup when
`install_popular` is enabled (the default). This covers the most popular
programming languages, common config/data formats (JSON, YAML, TOML, XML,
INI, Dockerfile, Makefile), and parsers needed by popular plugins like
[render-markdown.nvim](https://github.com/MeanderingProgrammer/render-markdown.nvim)
(markdown, markdown_inline, html, latex). Set `install_popular = false`
to disable. Use `ensure_installed` to add parsers beyond the popular set.

**Everything else** installs on demand — open a file and arborist handles
the rest.

## How It Works

1. You open a file
2. Arborist checks if a parser exists for that filetype
3. If not, it installs one:
   - Download pre-built WASM from CDN (fastest)
   - Clone source and `tree-sitter build --wasm`
   - Clone source and `tree-sitter build` (native .so)
4. Highlighting and indentation activate immediately

WASM steps are skipped entirely if your Neovim build lacks wasmtime.

Parser locations are resolved from a
[community registry](https://github.com/arborist-ts/registry) covering
326 parsers. Unknown parsers fall back to convention-based lookup in the
`tree-sitter-grammars` and `tree-sitter` GitHub orgs.

User queries in `~/.config/nvim/queries/` always take highest priority.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `:Arborist` | Show installed parsers and status |
| `:ArboristInstall {lang}` | Install a parser manually |
| `:ArboristUpdate` | Check all parsers for updates |
| `:ArboristClean` | Remove all arborist-managed parsers and cache |

## Requirements

- Neovim 0.12+
- `git` and `curl`
- `tree-sitter` CLI (for building from source)
- A C compiler (fallback when `tree-sitter` CLI is unavailable)
- For WASM: Neovim built with `ENABLE_WASMTIME=ON`
